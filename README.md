# StayWise

StayWise is a modern TypeScript-based web application focused on delivering a reliable, maintainable, and well-typed frontend experience. This README provides a comprehensive guide to the project: what it is, how to set it up locally, how to contribute, and how to deploy.

> Note: This repository is primarily written in TypeScript (≈96.9%), with a small amount of CSS and JavaScript. The instructions below are intentionally framework-agnostic: if your project uses Next.js, Create React App, Vite, or another TypeScript-friendly scaffold, substitute the framework-specific commands where noted.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
